# AI-Based-Animal-Identifier
Developed a machine learning application that classifies animals from image data using both deep learning and traditional classification models. The system preprocesses image datasets and compares the performance of three models:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for advanced feature learning

Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers for fast, interpretable baselines

Implemented using Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, OpenCV, and Pandas, the project includes:

Image normalization, grayscale conversion, and dimensionality reduction using PCA

Model training and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Automatic generation of confusion matrix visualizations and a performance comparison chart

A robust structure to test and compare classical ML vs deep learning on the same dataset
